Prodigy_Infotech(Task-04)

In this task, I developed a simple Keylogger using Python to record keystrokes typed by a user. The program captures all keyboard inputs and logs them into a .txt file for monitoring and analysis. It handles special keys like space and enter and avoids logging unwanted system combinations. The project demonstrates how keystroke data can be captured in real time using libraries like pynput.
